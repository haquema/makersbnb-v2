We are team Nijinsky

Bearing in mind the EQ learning weâ€™ve done with Dana and elsewhere, we want to foster a good team to work in

We plan to meet
At 10am for morning standup
At 2pm for afternoon standup
Time dependent for a retro at the end of the day

We value:
Honesty 
Communication - (feedback)
Compassion
Learning
Awareness of others needs
(in that order)

We will have a nominated leader/spokesperson which will rotate daily

When we are upset we will raise it immediately in the Slack channel, separating the facts and the story as far as we are able, and giving actionable, specific and kind feedback as appropriate
